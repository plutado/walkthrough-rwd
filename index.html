            When I was developing newspaper sites in 2007 - 2011,
            everyone felt confident where "above the fold" and "below
            the fold" existed.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="fragment">
            The idea of "above the fold" was adopted from print.  Above
            the fold means all of the content a user can see on their
            screen without scrolling down.  This came from the idea that
            real newspapers are folded when you buy them - the top half
            that users can see without unfolding the paper was literally
            "above the fold".
          </p>

        <section>
          <p class="fragment">
            Our users had a smaller range of monitor resolutions.
            As long as their monitors were at least 1024px wide, they got the
            optimal user experience our industry provided, and we could make
            reasonable assertions (within a couple hundred pixels), of where
            "above the fold" was on their screens.

          <h2>So what is Responsive Web Design?</h2>

          <blockquote>
            Responsive Web Design is a methodology for building websites without favor towards
            specific devices, platforms, or resolution sizes, as such that the website is optimized
            at all viewport widths, for all devices, in all platforms and that utilize a modern browser.
          </blockquote>
        </section>

        <section>
          <blockquote>
            Effective responsive Web Design has to be a "content-first" approach, where content components
            are be developed to be fully responsive at any viewport width on it's own merits, regardless
            of whether the breakpoints used are or are not in concert with other components or happen at
            device specific resolutions.

        <section>
          If you (or other people you can’t control) must use photoshop for web design,
          please also use <br>
          <b>Adobe Edge Reflow</b> <br>or <b>Webflow</b><br> or <b>Macwaw</b><br>
          in your workflow.

          These applications can be used in conjuction with Photoshop as rapid prototyping tools.
        </section>

        <section>
          It can also be effective if Photoshop designs are limited the largest viewport width.
          The look and feel would then be driven by this as a guideline, but response behavior
          done through rapid prototyping in the browser, and through actual responsive design.

        <section>
          <p>
            Since the majority of devices that will access our site will be mobile devices,
            we need to set a viewport metatag to ensure the browser behaves properly.

            Note: only disable zoom on your site if there's a very good reason to,
            as there are many reasons a site visitor could want to use zoom when visiting
            your website.

          If we're trying to get away from the paradigm of 'device' centric labels in responsive web design,
          then the phrase "mobile first responsive design" is a bad one.  Many people take 'mobile first' to
          mean:
