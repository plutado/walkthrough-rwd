  <h1>What is responsive web design?</h1>
  <p class="fragment">Let's first examine each word.</p>
  <p class="fragment">What's the most important word of the three?</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The most important word in the phrase </p>
  <h2><i>Responsive Web Design</i></h2>
  <h3 class="fragment">
    <em>is Web</em>
  </h3>
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p class="fragment">Because 'web' is the <em>medium</em> we're 'designing' for,
    and 'responsive' is just an adjective that describes the kind of web we're building.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  I believe that very soon, we’ll no longer say Responsive Web Design, we will simply call it Web Design
</section>

<section>
  <blockquote class="fragment">
    The key to creating a successful <br><b>responsive web design</b><br> is understanding
    the web.
  </blockquote>
  <br>
  <blockquote class="fragment">
    The web is powerful and unique,<br> so we should leverage it's advantages.
  </blockquote>
  <p class="fragment">but also...</p>
  <blockquote class="fragment">
    We should discard any outmoded mental models we've borrowed from other mediums
    that fail to serve us well on the web.

  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">PRINT</li>

  <blockquote class="fragment">
    When television was in it's infancy, <br>
    most of the stars came from radio, and the first programs
    borrowed their formats from radio, such as
    radio plays, variety shows, and orchestra concerts.
  </blockquote>
  <br>
  <blockquote class="fragment">
    The radio plays in particular weren't 'movie versions' of popular plays -
    these were literally radio actors, filmed in
    front of microphones, reading.

    That was TV!

    It took a few years for creators to experiment
    and leverage the advantages that television offers
    that are not accessible (or even possible) to do on radio.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  On the web, we still face a similar story.
</section>

<section>
  <p>
    When I was developing newspaper sites in 2007 - 2011,
    everyone felt confident where "above the fold" and "below
    the fold" existed.
  </p>
  <p class="fragment">
    The idea of "above the fold" was adopted from print.  Above
    the fold means all of the content a user can see on their
    screen without scrolling down.  This came from the idea that
    real newspapers are folded when you buy them - the top half
    that users can see without unfolding the paper was literally
    "above the fold".
  </p>
  <br>
</section>

<section>
  <p class="fragment">
    Our users had a smaller range of monitor resolutions.
    As long as their monitors were at least 1024px wide, they got the
    optimal user experience our industry provided, and we could make
    reasonable assertions (within a couple hundred pixels), of where
    "above the fold" was on their screens.
  </p>
</section>

  <h2>Before the web needed to be</h2>
  <h1>responsive,</h1>
  <h2>"print and graphic design thinking" worked pretty well.</h2>
  <br><br>
  <h2><em>But those days are over.</em></h2>
</section>

<section>
  The fact is:
</section>

<section>
  <h2>You shouldn't use photoshop to design a responsive web site.</h2>
  <h3><em>(because photoshop is for static print design)</em></h3>
</section>

<section>
  <p>
    The prevalence of smart phones and iPads during the emergence of responsive web design
    had an unexpected and unfortunate consequence...
  </p>
  <h3>
    With "graphic design thinking" dominating our habits, we merely shifted the
    erroneous idea of a 'page', and began instead to refer to 'device layouts'.
  </h3>
</section>

<section>
  <h2><em>How does my site look in the: </em></h2>
  <h2 class="fragment">Mobile Layout?</h2>
  <h2 class="fragment">Tablet Layout?</h2>
  <small class="fragment">Wait, do you mean portrait or landscape?</small>
  <h2 class="fragment">Desktop Layout?</h2>

<section>
  <blockquote class="fragment">
    Our designers will just create 3 different PSDs, one for each breakpoint!
  </blockquote>
  <br>
  <blockquote class="fragment">
    If we implement those in pixel perfect fashion, our work here is done!
  </blockquote>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>
    It's taken a log time for us to realize what happens <em>between</em><br>
    breakpoints is just as important as what happens at the breakpoints.
  </h2>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>A responsive site that is designed <br><i>for the browser</i></h2>
  <br>
  <h2>should also be designed <br><i>in the browser.</i></h2>

<section>
  <h2>Forget about pixel perfection at <br>idealized breakpoints or devices.</h2>
  <h2><em>Aim instead for <br>perfect responsiveness.</em></h2>

  <h2>As the web has become more and more </h2>
  <h1>responsive,</h1>
  <h2>a unique characteristic of the web has become more obvious:</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Using graphic design tools to build <br>responsive sites no longer works</h2>
  <br>
  <h2>in a medium where device <br>resolutions are no longer predictable.</h2>
</section>

<section>
  When some mobile phones have larger resolutions than some tablets, and some tablets have larger resolutions
  than desktop monitors, not to mention the hybrids devices: phablets (the phone tablet), and the netbook (not
  quite a tablet, not quite a desktop), using 'device labels' as responsive guides are basically meaningless.
</section>

<section>
  <h2>
    If you think about it, the idea of <br>having 'device layout' constructs <br>define your
    responsive design is silly.

  <h2>Using graphic design tools to build <br>responsive sites no longer works</h2>
  <h2>in a medium where pages <br>no longer exist.</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>All we have is the viewport <br>(the area on the screen that users can currently see).</h2>
  <h2>But we have no control over viewport resolutions of the devices used by <br>visitors to access our sites.</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>So what is Responsive Web Design?</h2>

  <blockquote>
    Responsive Web Design is a methodology for building websites without favor towards
    specific devices, platforms, or resolution sizes, as such that the website is optimized
    at all viewport widths, for all devices, in all platforms and that utilize a modern browser.
  </blockquote>
</section>

<section>
  <blockquote>
    Effective responsive Web Design has to be a "content-first" approach, where content components
    are be developed to be fully responsive at any viewport width on it's own merits, regardless
    of whether the breakpoints used are or are not in concert with other components or happen at
    device specific resolutions.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Let's face it:</h2>
  <h1>Photoshop happens.</h1>

<section>
  If you (or other people you can’t control) must use photoshop for web design,
  please also use <br>
  Adobe Edge Reflow <br>or Webflow<br> or Macwaw<br>
  in your workflow.

  <h2>Transition Styles</h2>
  <p>
    You can select from different transitions, like: <br>

  <h2>Global State</h2>
  <p>
    Set <code>data-state="something"</code> on a slide and <code>"something"</code>
    will be added as a class to the document element when the slide is open. This lets you
    apply broader style changes, like switching the background.

  <h2>Custom Events</h2>
  <p>
    Additionally custom events can be triggered on a per slide basis by binding to the <code>data-state</code> name.
